 # add-animation-to-your-shopping-app-Task
 # overview
 add an animation after clicking the close button in the dialog after signing up successfully that makes the sign up page fade out and the shopping page fades in.
 # What This Code Does ?
- The code incorporates animations to:
1. Fade in the entire signup page when it loads.
2. Fade out the success dialog and smoothly transition to the homepage upon signup completion.
# How the Code Works ?
1. Animation Initialization
 - The Signup class state includes SingleTickerProviderStateMixin to enable animation control.
 - An AnimationController and an Animation<double> are used to define and control the animation.
 - In initState, the AnimationController is initialized with a duration of 2 seconds, and a Tween is used to define the animation range (from 0.0 to 1.0)
2. Fade-in Effect
 - When the page is built, _controller.forward() starts the animation, making the entire signup page fade in.
 - The FadeTransition widget wraps the main content of the signup page and applies the opacity animation.
3. Smooth Transition to Homepage
 - When the "OK" button on the success dialog is pressed, the animation controller is triggered to complete its forward motion.
 - A PageRouteBuilder is used for the transition, applying a FadeTransition between the signup page and the homepage.
